# Data Files

Data files are `xxx.dat` files generally located in the XIV client folder and sub folders at `<..>\Documents\My Games\FINAL FANTASY XIV - A Realm Reborn\`.

## [Character Creator Presets](ffxiv_chara_xx.md)

The FFXIV Character Creator saves presets, when saving a character appearance at the end of character creation, in a file called `FFXIV_CHARA_XX.dat` where `XX` is the preset slot number from `01` to `40`.

## [Character Data Folder](ffxiv_chr_folder.md)

All data related to characters that have been used on the current machine is saved in a folder called `FFXIV_CHRxxxx` where `xxxx` is a unique ID for the character.

This folder contains `*.dat` files for character settings, hotbars and UI configuration, macros and so on, as well as a `log` folder containing the chat logs.
